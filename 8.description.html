        <dt><b>java</b></dt>
        <dd><i>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile</i></dd>
        <dt><b>C</b></dt>
        <dd><i>C is an incredibly efficient language. It offers low-level access to memory and provides inherent support for complex expressions, making it an ideal choice for system-level programming. The language is also flexible, offering the programmer a great deal of control.</i></dd>
        <dt><b>python</b></dt>
        <dd><i>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.</i></dd>
        <dt><b>Web Technology</b></dt>
        <dd><i>Web technology is the collection of tools, methods, and software that are used to create, develop, and maintain websites and web applications. It is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of technologies, but at its core, web technology is about building and delivering content and services over the Internet.</i></dd>
        <dt><b>R programming</b></dt>
        <dd><i>R is an implementation of the programming language S. Similarly, it allows users to implement new functionalities by defining new functions. It also has integration capabilities with C and C++. </i></dd>
